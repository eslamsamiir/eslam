          <p>Was it enough? That was the question he kept asking himself.
            Was being satisfied enough? He looked around him at everyone
            yearning to just be satisfied in their daily life and he had
            reached that goal. He knew that he was satisfied and he also
            knew it wasn't going to be enough.</p>
          <p>"Are you getting my texts???" she texted to him. He glanced
            at it and chuckled under his breath. Of course he was getting
            them, but if he wasn't getting them, how would he ever be able
            to answer? He put the phone down and continued on his project.
            He was ignoring her texts and he planned to continue to do so.</p>

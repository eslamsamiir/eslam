          <p>Was it enough? That was the question he kept asking himself.
            Was being satisfied enough? He looked around him at everyone
            yearning to just be satisfied in their daily life and he had
            reached that goal. He knew that he was satisfied and he also
            knew it wasn't going to be enough.</p>
          <p>"Are you getting my texts???" she texted to him. He glanced
            at it and chuckled under his breath. Of course he was getting
            them, but if he wasn't getting them, how would he ever be able
            to answer? He put the phone down and continued on his project.
            He was ignoring her texts and he planned to continue to do so.</p>
          <p>Turning away from the ledge, he started slowly down the mountain,
            deciding that he would, that very night, satisfy his curiosity
            about the man-house. In the meantime, he would go down into the
            canyon and get a cool drink, after which he would visit some berry
            patches just over the ridge, and explore among the foothills a bit
            before his nap-time, which always came just after the sun had walked
            past the middle of the sky. At that period of the day the sunâ€™s warm
            rays seemed to cast a sleepy spell over the silent mountainside, so
            all of the animals, with one accord, had decided it should be the
            hour for their mid-day sleep.</p>
          <p>Her eyebrows were a shade darker than her hair. They were thick
            and almost horizontal, emphasizing the depth of her eyes. She was
            rather handsome than beautiful. Her face was captivating by reason
            of a certain frankness of expression and a contradictory subtle
            play of features. Her manner was engaging.</p>
